## Some additional information
There are two variants of the recursive descent calculator.
recursiveDescentCalculator.jl implements a calculator. 
The other example simply accepts or rejects the given expression. 

## Example on how to run the recursive descent calculator 
```
> julia recursiveDescentCalculator.jl
Enter expression  => (4+4)*3  
Result of res is: 24.0
Enter expression  => (4+4)*3+(4+4)*3
Result of res is: 48.0
Enter expression  => 9/3
